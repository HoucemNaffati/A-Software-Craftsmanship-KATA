# TimedMessageGenerator: a software craftsmanship KATA

### Why do I need to train myself on this ? 

[**_Phil Crosby_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_B._Crosby) said:

It is always cheaper to do the job right the first time. 
If we deliver on time, but the product has defects, we have not delivered on time.

Software means an easy-to-change product. It needs to be easy to change and to adapt at any moment.
If you find that after each requirements' change, your team are redoing the same application over and over again, 
then you defenitely need TDD and design skills.

### Is this suitable for my coding level ?

Well, you will need to have a strong OOP background and a good understanding of hexagonal architecture principles, duh!

You can find my guidelines [here](OurRules.md).

### Let's rock'n'roll!

This is an advanced exercise to introduce TDD|SOLID|Hexagonal Architecture.

1. Implement example-mapped [**specifications**](Spec.md) using TDD. (~45min)
2. Try to apply craftsmanship's [**rules and principles**](OurRules.md).
3. Experience the impact of the following [**changes**](Changes.md) on your code "_**in the given order**_" to measure your level of success.

### How to measure success ?

###### Clean code should be easily readable by a non-programmer person.
###### Clean design should be able to adapt quickly without impacting your test suite.
###### Your solution is easily testable.
###### The cost of changing UI librarie or frameworks is signifincally cheap.
###### You felt happy that you received a change or a a new requirement.
###### Your confident that your solution is out of bugs at any time.
###### Your application is always in a shippable status.


##### Happy coding FOLKS !
