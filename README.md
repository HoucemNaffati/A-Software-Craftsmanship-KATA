Advanced exercise to introduce Example Mapping|TDD|Hexagonal Architecture.

1. Implement example-mapped [**specifications**](Spec.md) using TDD. (~45min)
2. Try to apply craftsmanship's [**rules and principles**](OurRules.md).
3. Experience the impact of the following [**changes**](Changes.md) on your code "_**in the given order**_" to measure your level of success.

### Clean code should be able to adapt quickly without impacting your test suite

##### Happy coding FOLKS !
### check my implementation [here](./app).
