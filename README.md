### Why do I need to try this out ?

It is always cheaper to do the job right the first time. 
If we deliver on time, but the product has defects, we have not delivered on time.

Software means easy-to-change-product. It needs to be easy to change and to adapt at any moment.
If you find that your team are redoing the same applications over and over again each time the requirements change, 
then you defenitely need TDD and design skills.

### Is this suitable for my level ?

Well, you will need to have a strong OOP background and a good understanding of hexagonal architecture principles.

I tried to give you guidelines [here](OurRules.md).

### Here you go

This is an advanced exercise to introduce Example Mapping|TDD|Hexagonal Architecture.

1. Implement example-mapped [**specifications**](Spec.md) using TDD. (~45min)
2. Try to apply craftsmanship's [**rules and principles**](OurRules.md).
3. Experience the impact of the following [**changes**](Changes.md) on your code "_**in the given order**_" to measure your level of success.

##### Clean code should be able to adapt quickly without impacting your test suite.

##### Happy coding FOLKS !

### Check out my implementation [here](./app). 
Please feel free to submit issues for improvement or create branches with example of your solution.
