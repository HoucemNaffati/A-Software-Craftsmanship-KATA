# TimedMessageGenerator: <br>A software craftsmanship KATA

### I. Why do I need to train myself on this ?

A software means an easy-to-change product. 
It needs to be easy to change and to adapt at any moment.
If you find that after each requirement's change, your team are redoing the same application over and over again, :trollface: 
then you defenitely need TDD and design skills. :pill: :gem:

### II. Is this suitable for my coding level ?

Well, you will need to have a strong OOP background and a good understanding of hexagonal architecture principles. :warning:

You can find my guidelines [here](OurRules.md). :book:

### III. Let's rock'n'roll!

This is an advanced exercise to introduce _TDD_, _SOLID_ design principles and _Hexagonal Architecture_. :computer:

1. Implement example-mapped [**specifications**](Spec.md) using TDD. (~45min is a reasonable estimation) :hammer:
2. Try to apply craftsmanship's [**rules and principles**](OurRules.md). :wrench:
3. Experience the impact of the following [**changes**](Changes.md) on your code "_**in the given order**_" to measure your level of success. :ghost:

### IV. How to measure success ? :dart:

- Clean code should be easy to read by a non-programmer person.:surfer:

- Clean design should be able to quickly adapt without impacting your tests.:ok_hand:

- Your solution is tested easily.:dash:

- The cost of changing UI library or framework is significantly cheap.:relaxed:

- You felt happy that you had received a change or a new requirement.:sparkles:

- You are confident that your solution is out of bugs at any time.:sunny:

- Your application is always ready to be shipped.:rocket:
