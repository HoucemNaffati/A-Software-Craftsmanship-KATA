### Why do I need to try this out ?

It is always cheaper to do the job right the first time. 
If we deliver on time, but the product has defects, we have not delivered on time.

Software means an easy-to-change product. It needs to be easy to change and to adapt at any moment.
If you find that after each requirements' change, your team are redoing the same application over and over again, 
then you defenitely need TDD and design skills.

### Is this suitable for my level ?

Well, you will need to have a strong OOP background and a good understanding of hexagonal architecture principles, duh!

You can find my guidelines [here](OurRules.md).

### Let's rock'n'roll!

This is an advanced exercise to introduce Example Mapping|TDD|Hexagonal Architecture.

1. Implement example-mapped [**specifications**](Spec.md) using TDD. (~45min)
2. Try to apply craftsmanship's [**rules and principles**](OurRules.md).
3. Experience the impact of the following [**changes**](Changes.md) on your code "_**in the given order**_" to measure your level of success.

##### Clean code should be able to adapt quickly without impacting your test suite.

##### Happy coding FOLKS !

### Check out my implementation [here](./app). 
Please feel free to submit issues for improvements or create branches with examples of your solutions.
