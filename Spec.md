# Timed Message Generator

Use a clock, interpret values so you can every second 

   - If the second is **not** divisible by 10(except for 0)
       FizzBuzz:
       - if divisible by 3 => Fizz
       - if divisible by 5 => Buzz
       - if divisible by 3 and by 5 => value of the second

   - else (second is divisible by 10)
       Happy:
       - generate a random number between 1 and 10 :
         - if the random value is equal to '7' => Happy 
         - else => Unhappy
   
  **Examples**<br>
       - 0->Fizz Buzz(this is an exception because divisible by 10)
       - 1->1
       - 3->Fizz
       - 4->4
       - 5->Buzz
       - 15->Fizz Buzz
       - 20 ->
            based on random value :<br>
             - 6 -> UnHappy
             - 7 -> Happy
             - 8 -> UnHappy
             - 11 -> out of bound exception
