# Planning

- Always Ask for examples. (not only you will need them for tests but also they clarify details and estimates)
- Always Challenge examples. (it is never enough details)
- Always precise obvious cases, express them with examples.
- Never forget edge cases. (don't make decisions instead of your client)
- Never forget exceptions.

# Architecture:

- We use [**Hexagonal Architecture**](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/) principles.

# Coding principles:

- Public methods are ruled by contracts, never change the signature.
- Coding by wishful thinking.
- YAGNI: You Are Not Gonna Need It !
- BoyScout Principle: “Try and leave the world a little better than you found it”.[Robert Baden-Powell]
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- KISS: Keep It Simple(Stupid).
- Tell don't ask.

### SOLID:

  #### SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

- A class, a function, a variable should have a unique functional reason to change.
- Always think about functional responsibility within an abstraction layer.
- How to be sure that I am not getting it wrong: 
    Within a given abstraction layer, name the element by its functional responsibilities (Aggregate and hide details).
    => If the name contains OR | AND then SRP is violated.

  #### OCP: Open Closed Principle

- Each public class or function should be closed to modification and opened for extension:
- Changing details requirements should remain in the details (private utilities methods or dependencies)
- Adding a new case of the same rule should'nt push you to modify the signature or the implementation 
  of your exposed methods.
  
  #### LSP: Liskov substitution principle
  
- If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without 
  altering any of the desirable properties of that program
  
  ##### ISP: Interface segregation principle
  
- Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
     
  #### DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle  
  
- The use case doesn't instantiate its dependencies, but it only defines them (contracts).
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions(contracts).
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.



# Testing:

- NEVER TEST TECHNICAL DETAILS

- NEVER TEST PRIVATES

- Tests are independent and isolated. One test should never influence a second one.

- Stub Never Mock: 

[**What are test-doubles ?**](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/14/TheLittleMocker.html)

[**Why should you avoid mocking ?**](https://www.openmymind.net/2011/3/23/Stop-Using-Mocks/)

## Unit Tests

- It Validates functional specifications.
- It vaptures behaviors and no technical details.
- It allow Algorithm discovery.
- Those tests provide **immediate** feedback when developing existing or new features. 
- They are extremely fast. (~1second)
- It stubs dependencies.
- It is framework independent.
- It grants functional non regression as a consequence.

## Integration Tests

> It validates that dependencies behave as expected.
> In general, it tests what we stubbed in unit tests.

## E2E tests

- It is a test that crosses all layers (UI, Config, Service, UseCase...) and grants the expected behaviour from the point of view of the user.
- No mocks, no stubs, no fakes...they are system tests.
- We do little E2E testing because they are fragile and can break easily.
- UI details can change easily so you can do snapshot testing (happy and failure scenarios) to capture accidental
      regressions.

# Smells:

- Broken SRP: After naming correctly, the name contains OR or AND.
- BAD Design: Changing method visibility only to be able to test it.
- Tests are not UNIT: Test suite passes some time, some times not.
- Test FOCUS: changing technical details break one or more tests.

# TDD
- We do Baby Steps and discover design by following what the tests need incrementally.

red -> green -> refactor -> red...
    red: I dont write any production code unless I have a failing unit test that require it.
    green: I write minimum code that strictly satisfies the test.
    refactor: I make the code S.O.L.I.D
