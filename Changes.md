# Possible changes:
:zero: Formatting: 
    Display all the messages in uppercase and replace the spaces with '**'. 

:one: Advanced Display: 
    We want to output the unique message, which contains all the values (Fuse 'Fizz Buzz' and 'Happy').
````
    in->out
    0 ->0-Fizz Buzz-Happy or unHappy
    1 ->1-1-Happy or UnHappy
    2 ->2-2-Happy or UnHappy
    3 ->3-Fizz-Happy or UnHappy
    10->10-Buzz-Happy or unHappy
    15->15-Fizz Buzz-Happy or unHappy
    21->21-Fizz-Happy or unHappy

:two: Happy Hour: 
    Every day, between 17h30 et 18h , the chance is higher to have Happy by 2.
    
:three: More profit during the rush Hours: between 8h-10h: 
    the chance is lower to have Happy by 4.

:four: Best Client Feature:
    We want to add a forth message at the end: 
    Display "FULL ODD" when the hour, minute and second are ODD or "FULL EVEN" otherwise.
  
:five: Synchronization problem: 
    Use an api like (http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip)[http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip] to fetch the time based on the IP address.

:six: ExperiencedUsers: 
    For the deterministic part of the game we want to interpret the whole interval [min(lastrandom, second%10],         max(lastrandom,second%10)] and display the full fuzz buzz serie.
  ```` 
  example:
  random= 5
  second%10 =52 %10 = 2
  => 2-2-Happy or UnHappy|3-Fizz-Happy or UnHappy|4-4-Happy or UnHappy|5-Buzz-Happy or UnHappy
